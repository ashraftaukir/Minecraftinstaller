# Minecraft Installer - Fixed Version

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SAF Directory Access Problem
**Problem**: The app wasn't prompting users to select the Minecraft directory using SAF folder picker.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the directory access flow to properly request SAF permissions
- Added proper initial URI pointing to the Minecraft folder structure
- Implemented pending file handling when directory access is needed
- Added clear user instructions during directory selection

### 2. File Installation Location
**Problem**: Files weren't being installed to the correct Minecraft folders.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the folder path logic to properly navigate to existing Minecraft folders
- Corrected the path constants to use relative paths (`minecraftWorlds`, `resource_packs`)
- Added proper folder creation and navigation logic
- Implemented nested directory handling for zip extraction

### 3. Package Structure
**Problem**: Compilation errors due to inconsistent package names and R class issues.

**Solution**:
- Unified package structure: `com.acimis.minecraftinstaller`
- Consistent namespace, applicationId, and Java package
- Proper R class generation and import

## Key Improvements

1. **Better User Experience**:
   - Clear status messages during installation
   - Proper error handling and user feedback
   - Unique folder naming to prevent conflicts

2. **Robust File Handling**:
   - Proper zip extraction with nested directory support
   - File name sanitization
   - Duplicate handling with automatic renaming

3. **SAF Implementation**:
   - Correct use of `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`
   - Proper permission persistence
   - Fallback handling for different Android versions

## Testing Instructions

1. **Install the app** on a Samsung Android device
2. **Select a .mcworld or .mcpack file** using the app
3. **Grant directory access** when prompted - select the `com.mojang` folder inside Minecraft
4. **Verify installation** by checking the Minecraft game for the new world/resource pack

## Technical Details

- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)

- **Package**: `com.acimis.minecraftinstaller` (consistent across all files)
- **Dependencies**: Apache Commons Compress, AndroidX DocumentFile, Material Design

## File Structure

The app now correctly installs files to:
- **Worlds**: `Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/[world_name]/`
- **Resource Packs**: `Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/resource_packs/[pack_name]/`
